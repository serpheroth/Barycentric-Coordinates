Barycentric Coordinates Demo / Model View Demo

To build:
    ./build.sh

To run:
    ./demo models/testdata.tri

If you have glew installed (needed for pixel shading) you can enable it with
the -DGLEW_SUPPORT directive. Otherwise, it will just use regular OpenGL to
draw the scene.


::For Barycentric Coordinate Demo::
  Click and drag on the corners of the triangle to move it around.
  Press W to enable or disable the wireframe view.

::For Model View Demo::
  Drag the model around with your mouse. Since the program uses quaternions,
  the model will change with respect to its current orientation, hopefully
  making rotation more natural and intuitive.

  Press w to toggle wireframe.
  Press n to display normals.
  Press s to enable specular.
  Press a to enable antialiasing/smooth shading.
