Barycentric Coordinates Demo

To build:
    ./build.sh

To run:
    ./triangle testdata.tri

If you have glew installed (needed for pixel shading) you can enable it with
the -DGLEW_SUPPORT directive. Otherwise, it will just use regular OpenGL to
draw the scene.

Click and drag on the corners of the triangle to move it around.
